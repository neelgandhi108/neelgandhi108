👋 Hello, I'm @neelgandhi108, currently pursuing my studies in computer science at Dartmouth College.

🧠 My interests lie in the realms of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and natural language processing. I've delved into projects that revolve around these domains.

🛠️ Crafting immersive web and mobile experiences is my forte, leveraging tools such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React Native, and Flutter. My backend finesse extends to Django, Node.js, and Firebase, enriching the user journey.

🚀 Navigating the development landscape seamlessly, I wield proficiency in a plethora of tools, including Git, AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, and Azure. This empowers me to orchestrate robust end-to-end solutions.

📚 Currently, my focus lies in understanding transformer models and language processing as part of my ongoing research. I'm dedicated to broadening my horizons in computer science and its allied fields.

🤝 I'm enthusiastic about collaborating on projects that encompass AI, ML, or NLP, and those that apply computer science to real-world challenges. I'm equally eager to explore new horizons and learn from fellow enthusiasts.

📬 Feel free to connect with me via my GitHub profile or drop me an email at neelgandhi11@gmail.com. I'm always open to discussions about potential projects or opportunities.
