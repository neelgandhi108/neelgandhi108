👋 Hi, I’m @neelgandhi108. I’m a computer science student at Dartmouth College.



👀 I’m interested in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and natural language processing, and I have experience working on projects in these areas.


🌱 I’m currently learning about transformer and language models as part of my research, and I’m always looking to expand my knowledge and skills in computer science and related fields.


💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that involve AI, ML, or NLP, or that apply computer science to real-world problems. I’m also open to exploring new areas and learning from others.


📫 You can reach me through my GitHub profile or by emailing me at neelgandhi11@gmail.com. I’m always happy to connect and discuss potential projects or opportunities.
